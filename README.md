Parametrized String is a small library allowing to includes some "parameters" in a string. The main advantage to use this library is you can handle delimiter easily.
For example :

string path = {Drive}\{UserDocumentPath}\{AppName}.{ExtApp}
string path2 = $Drive$\$UserDocumentPath$\$AppName$.$ExtApp$
